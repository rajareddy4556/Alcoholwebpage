<h1>Alcohol</h1>
<h2>What is alcohol?</h2>
<p>The term "alcohol" has been synonymous with "spirituous" liquids for the past 300 years. The history of alcohol consumption, along with codes limiting its consumption go back to 1700 B.C. <br> <h3>Types Of Alcohol:</h3>There are four types of alcohol: methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol and butyl alcohol. Ethyl Alcohol, or ethanol (C2H5OH), is the type used in the production of alcoholic beverages. The other three types, methyl, propyl and butyl alcohol, if consumed can result in blindness and death, even in relatively small doses.
Alcohol, or ethanol, is the intoxicating agent found in beer, wine and liquor. <h3>Making of Alcohol:</h3>Alcohol is produced by fermentation of yeast, sugars, and starches.1 Fruits such as grapes, and grains like barley and wheat are most commonly used for wine, beer and liquors. Other plants, such as the cactus or sugar cane may be used in liquor production.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<p>Consumption of small amounts of alcohol are reported to have beneficial cardiovascular health benefits, particularly the consumption of red wine. Red wine contains substances such as resveratrol and flavonoids that have antioxidant properties and may lend cardioprotective effects to the heart. However, only small amounts of wine or alcohol are suggested to be beneficial.
Antioxidants may help prevent heart disease by increasing levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good" cholesterol and protecting against artery damage. <br>Antioxidants in red wine are called polyphenols and may be protective for heart vessel linings. Resveratrol is a polyphenol that comes from the skins of red grapes. It is also theorized that the beneficial heart effects of red wine might be possible by simply drinking red or purple 100% grape juice or eating red grapes.

<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<P>
Long-term alcohol misuse is associated with liver and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and nervous system damage as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, and antisocial personality disorder
</p>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<P>The treatment of alcoholism requires strong family, social and medical support. Treatment for alcohol dependence usually involves a wide array of interventions, including stepped therapy, group support, individual counseling, and medications.
